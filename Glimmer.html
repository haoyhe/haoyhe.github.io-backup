				<h2 class="quote">"How can I help people find and meet up with friends easier in public places?"</h2>
				<h2 class="subtopic">Problem</h2>
				<h3 class="paragraph">Every day, many people may find themselves in a situation where they lose track of or cannot find their friends in public places especially in dense or crowded areas such shopping malls, stations, or concerts. While existing apps provide location tracking and map features, none have provided an easy & intuitive solution to help people locate and meet up with one another. What results is valuable time wasted for a small yet frustrating problem.</h3>
				<h2 class="subtopic">Solution</h2>
				<h3 class="paragraph">Glimmer is a real time location tracking app that guides users towards their friends via its unique “compass” feature. Simply follow the arrow on the compass and the distance marker and you will be at your friend’s relative location in no time. With Glimmer, say goodbye to annoying location mix-ups, confusing maps, and the occasional poor sense of direction.</h3>

			<h2 class="subtopic">Common Pain Points</h2>
			<h3 class="paragraph">I began by identifying common pain points and issues people face that can lead up to these location mishaps. Surveying friends, drawing from travel articles, and reflecting from my experiences abroad, I was able to narrow down three general pain points.</h3>
			<h3 class="subsubtopic">1. Unfamiliar Territory</h3>
			<h3 class="paragraph">Perhaps someone is meeting up with a friend in a new city or traveling in a foreign country. Many may agree to meet up at a specific destination but once they are there, they may find the location to be much more unaccustomed than they expected it to be. New places can also frequently be subject to mix-ups or misinterpretations.</h3>
			<h3 class="subsubtopic">2. Environmental Obstacles</h3>
			<h3 class="paragraph">Even in the most open of spaces, crowds of people can make a location almost un-navigable and finding others very difficult. In a park, trees and terrain can obstruct the field of view making it hard to see others. Complex places like shopping malls, train stations, or airports can make navigating especially confusing.</h3>
			<h3 class="subsubtopic">3. Map Confusion</h3>
			<h3 class="paragraph">Digital maps are by far the best tools for navigation. However, many may still struggle to use maps as a reference to their surroundings. Studies have shown that some people struggle cognitively to translate their physical street-view perspective into the visual bird’s-eye view on a map. This confusion is further worsened especially in new and unfamiliar places. There also is a lack of accurate mapping data in many indoor or complex locations.</h3>

			<h2 class="subtopic">Typical Cases</h2>
			<h3 class="paragraph">The constructed conversations below provides an insight into typical cases of how our pain points can cause unnecessary confusion and inconvenience.</h3>

                        <h3 class="paragraph">An arrow is probably the most simple and intuitive tool to guide someone from point A to point B, especially in places where traditional maps are of little use. Similar to a magnetic compass, the Glimmer compass would act as an arrow that always points towards the location of a friend and adjusts itself based on the direction you are facing and the orientation of your device. The distance counter would display the net distance between the user and their friend.</h3>

            <h3 class="paragraph">This was the first app design project I’ve done that went through the full design process. While, I did not follow any rigid guides, I was able to experiment and develop my own process and approach to product conceptualization and user centered design. I found this project challenging yet very enjoyable because I was able to combine my creative side with the analytical side required to design a well rounded product. This experience also convinced me that I want to continue solving problems involving navigation and travel in the future.</h3>

For that reason, I want to move forward with actual development of Glimmer and to further validate its potential to be a viable product.</h3>
